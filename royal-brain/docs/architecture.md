# Royal BrAIn™ — Architecture (Day 1)
## Purpose
Royal BrAIn™ is designed to act as a cognitive authority and global authoritative standard for legitimacy validation. The system must be interoperable and independently auditable from its first day.

## Monorepo structure
- `backend/`: deterministic API, identity, authority enforcement, audit trail
- `frontend/`: minimal institutional console
- `docs/`: authoritative reference material

## Sovereign engines (future)
The Whitepaper defines four interoperable sovereign engines:
- Global Nobility Law Engine™
- Global Heraldic Engine™
- Global Genealogy Engine™
- Global Chivalric Orders Engine™

Day 1 implements the foundation (identity, authority, auditability) on which these engines can be built and audited independently.

## Trust layer (future)
The Whitepaper describes a Sovereign Trust Layer™ (immutable, auditable, certifiable). Day 1 establishes an audit log with hashing fields to support later immutability chaining.

## AI layer (placeholder)
Model inference, dataset governance, and jurisdictional rule sets will be introduced as separate modules once identity/authority/audit guarantees are in place.
